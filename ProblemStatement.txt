Full Stack (MERN)
Create an application to display blog articles with the following features,
* Home page - Should show all the articles on the basis of the latest article first, user should be able to know if he is logged in or not. If not logged in he should be able to log in.
* Login Screen
* Sign up Screen
* If the user is logged in, the route '/user/username'  should show him his profile with all the articles he published. Else he will be taken to the home page
* The user should be able to create a new article if and only if he is logged in at the route '/publish'. Else he will be taken to the home page
 
Extra Points: 
* Add tags with the articles published and the route ‘/tags/<tagname>’ should give all the articles which contain the tag name
 
 Note:  
* Use JWT for authorization 
* For authentication, you can use what you prefer
* To view the published articles on the home page that are published by others, users login feature is not required
* Take only the basic information of the user such as email address, username, name, and age
*  If the user is not logged in any unintended route(eg, /user/username or /publish) will take him to the home screen.
